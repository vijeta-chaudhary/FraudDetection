# FraudDetection

Credit card fraud is a big problem for banks and people who use cards. It causes a lot of money to be lost and makes transactions less safe. The way we've been catching fraud isn't working as well with so many transactions happening online.

We have a bunch of data from 2023 showing over 550,000 credit card transactions made by people in Europe. We want to use computer models to help catch fraud better. We've tried different models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting to see which one works best.

We've also tried removing some parts of the data that don't seem important and fixing problems where different parts of the data seem too similar. This helps make the models work better.

Our main goal is to find the best model that can help banks catch fraud in credit card transactions made by European cardholders. By doing this, we hope to make transactions safer and prevent people from losing money because of fraud.
